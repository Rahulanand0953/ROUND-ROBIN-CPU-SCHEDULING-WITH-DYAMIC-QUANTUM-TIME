One of the most crucial problems in operating systems concepts is Scheduling the CPU to different processes and to design a particular system that will attain accurate results in scheduling. In case of priority based Round Robin scheduling algorithm when similar priority jobs arrive, the processes are executed based on FCFS. The processes have a specific burst time associated. A time quantum is set and the processes utilize the resources available for that time quantum only. Once the time quantum is crosses, the control is passed to the next process. The purpose of this project is to introduce an optimised variant to the round robin scheduling algorithm. Every algorithm works in its own way and has its own merits and demerits. A new CPU scheduling algorithm has been proposed, named as DABRR (Dynamic Average Burst Round Robin). That uses dynamic time quantum instead of static time quantum used in RR. The proposed algorithm overcomes the shortfalls of the existing scheduling algorithms in terms of waiting time, turnaround time, throughput and number of context switches. The algorithm is pre-emptive and works based on the priority of the associated processes. The performance of the proposed algorithm is experimentally compared with traditional RR and some existing variants of RR.
